# hello world

<Image src={dog} alt="dog" loading="eager" />

It's been some time that I code for my personal website. Trying out Astro for the first time and I'm excited to see how this goes. I'm also trying to learn in public, so I'll be documenting my journey here.

## why Astro?

I've been using Next.js for past few years in work and I love it. It's a great framework and backed by a great team. React as default in Next.js also bring great community support and ecosystem. However, I've been looking for something that's more lightweight and faster, and Astro seems to be a great fit. Though it means I'll have to learn a new framework, which is not a bad thing as I'm always looking to learn new things.

## tech stack

- Astro
- TypeScript
- shadcn/ui
- Tailwind CSS
- mdx
- Lighthouse (for performance audit)
- GitHub Pages
- and my passion

Alright, let's get started!
